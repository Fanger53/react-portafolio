                Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Software Developer from Colombia with experience in Html, Scss, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, and more technologies.

                I started my professional career in sales, but always in the background learning about the world of programming, since 2019  I dedicate myself full-time to it and I enjoy bringing the ideas I had in mind to life.

                I like search  solutions to problems in the real world and the software is a powerful tool to change the paradigms of people
